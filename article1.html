<em>Humne tujhpe hazaaro sitham hai kiye<br>
Humne tujhpe jahaa bhar ke zulm kiye<br>
Humne socha nahi, Tu jo udh jaayegi<br>
Ye zameen tere bin sooni reh jaayegi<br>
Kiske dum pe sajega mera angana<br>
O Ri Chiraiya, Nanhi si chidiya<br>
Angana mein phir aaja re…</em><br><br>
O Ri Chiraiya, a song from the soundtrack of Satyameva Jayate,<br> composed by Ram Sampath and lyrics by <br>Swanand Kirkire.<br><br>

Today, 11th October, is The International Day of the Girl Child. On this occasion, we would like to talk about something that has plagued humanity for many years and still does: Female Foeticide, or the destruction or abortion of a female fetus.

It's a more significant problem than we realize. The sex ratio at birth is naturally considered to be 105 males for every 100 females, but many countries have a skewed sex ration at birth. Sadly, India is no exception. According to the data from the Asian Center for Human Rights, there are 112 males for every 100 females in India. In fact, the problem of foeticide is much deeper than numbers. 
 
With the fast-paced technological advancements in the world, it is now possible to detect the gender of a fetus in the early stages of pregnancy. This has turned out to be the main reason for this skewed sex ratio. We could say that female foeticide is the most initial stage of gender discrimination as the sole reason for foeticide is that the fetus is a girl.
According to an official report by the Indian health ministry in 2013, preference towards a son and female foeticide, along with neglect of the girl child were the primary reasons for the higher mortality rate of girls at a younger age, and for the imbalanced sex ratio in India. 
 
With a population as large as India, even a few percentages of people believing that girls are burdensome to the family can make a huge difference.<br> 
•	The dowry system,<br>
•	or mindsets like "बेटी पराया धन होती है",<br>
•	men carry forward the family name and legacy and women don't; are a few reasons for the gender preference in India leading to female foeticide.<br>

In India, between 1990 and 2018, approximately 15.8 million girls went missing due to prenatal sex selection. The imbalance in sex ratio has also been related to violence towards women. 
A study by Sunita Bose and colleagues using the data from National Family Health Survey says that married women living in communities with low sex ratios are significantly more likely to have experienced physical violence from their husbands.

<div class="container-fluid py-5 ">
	<p class="px-5">The government has been taking steps to overcome this problem of foeticide and prenatal sex selection by implementing girl child protection schemes around the country. These include: - <br><br>
•	Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao <br>
•	The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) project has seen an improvement in the sex ratio in target districts in phase 1 and phase 2 of the project, which is excellent news!<br>
•	Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana which is a special savings scheme for daughters. <br>
•	Many states have also implemented such schemes as the Bhagyalakshmi scheme in Karnataka and Majhi Kanya Bhagyashree scheme in Maharashtra. <br>


The literacy rate of girls is also less in India due to gender preferences. Violence is faced by females, not only in India but around the world simply because of their gender.<br><br>

These problems will keep increasing unless we all come together and do what we can, however small or big, to reduce the cases of foeticide till there are none.<br><br>
•	The smallest acts like talking to people, showing them how foeticide and gender discrimination are wrong,<br> 
•	letting a victim know you're there to help them, supporting them in standing up for themselves or contacting authorities, <br>
•	reporting cases of violence or illegal foeticide that you might come across, 
•	educating not just the next generation, but also our parents and grandparents can all help in dealing with these issues. <br><br>
