Pusarla Venkata Sindhu, an Olympic medallist, is more than just a pioneer for Indian athletes, having paved a way for aspiring women all over the country. An ace shuttler – she was born to a pair of sportsmen on 5th July, 1995. Her mother P Vijaya, is a national level volleyball player, just like her father PV Raman, indicating that sport was clearly her calling since childhood. <br><br>
Though obvious expectation would have been for her to follow her parents’ footsteps in volleyball, she went on to become an International badminton sensation. Introduced to the sport at the age of eight, she become a student at Gopichand Badminton Academy under coach Pullela Gopichand.<br><br>
Her potential and talent were evident from her early performances, but she attained major recognition on coming 5th in the Servo All India championship for the under 10 category. Her upward trajectory continued when she received a gold medal in the 51st National School Games. <br><br>
Internationally, she debuted at the Sub-Junior Asian Badminton Championship in 2009, where she was awarded a bronze. At the International Badminton Challenge held in Iran in 2010, she became the runner up, which was followed by countless other silvers. “Silver Sindhu” – was the title given to her. At the tender age of 17, she won the Asian junior Championships, becoming a global badminton whiz. She bagged her first Grand Prix in 2013 and was awarded the Arjuna Award the following year – one of the highest honours for any sportsperson in India.<br><br>
However, the biggest moment in Sindhu’s career came in the year 2016, when she went on to become the youngest and the first female athlete from India to win a silver medal at the Rio Olympics. She lost to then World No.1 Carolina Marin of Spain on 19th August 2016 and was graced with India’s fourth highest civilian award, The Padma Shri, later that year.<br><br>
In 2017, Sindhu won the Indian Open Super Series and later added a silver at the BWF World Championships. After reaching the final of the 2018 World Championships, she became the first shuttler in the world to reach the finals of three major successive events. She also rose to a career high ranking of no.2 the same year. However, the Gold medal remained elusive and she had to settle for a silver each time. <br><br>
On 16th December 2018, Sindhu made history by becoming the first Indian to win the season ending BWF World Tour Finals Tournament in China.
Under the tutelage of Coach Pullela Gopichand, Sindhu is now no.7 in the world. With earnings of $8.5 million, she was ranked 7th in Forbes list of Highest-Paid Female Athletes in 2018, and was also the only Indian mentioned in the list. <br><br>
Her story is an inspiration to all the young Indian sportswomen today. She has filled our hearts with pride over the past decade with countless achievements though her dedication and hard work and has an incredibly honourable position in the history of Indian Sports.<br><br>
