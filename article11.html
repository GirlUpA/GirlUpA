Once there was a girl who loved to sleep in, to prevent this, her strict father would take her to her brother's cricket coaching sessions. Being a restless child, she would occasionally pick up a bat and hit a dozen balls along the ground as far as she could. Who would’ve thought that this 8 year old girl would go on to become India's greatest female batsman, the highest run-scorer in women's international cricket and the only female cricketer to surpass the 6,000 run mark in Women’s One Day International matches.<br><br>

Mithali Raj started playing cricket at the age of 10 and she was only 16 when she made her ODI debut on 26 June 1999 against Ireland and scored a cracking 114 runs. In her T20 debut against England, she scored 28 off 37 balls and India won the match by eight wickets. It was clear as day that Mithali had great talent and she was one of the most promising players in India but she took her game to the next level by becoming the world’s finest cricketer. Mithali held a record for the highest individual score by any Indian women cricketer in a world cup match, scoring 91 off 114 balls. Mithali is an all time leading run scorer in all formats of cricket for India. She has the record of scoring seven consecutive half centuries and holds the record for most consecutive ODIs played for a team. Mithali’s undeniable talent and sheer skill in the game contributed greatly to the Indian Team for which she was honored by the Arjuna Award for Cricket in the year 2003 and the Padma Shri in 2015 which is India’s fourth highest civilian award. She was also awarded the Youth Sports Icon of Excellence Award, Vogue Sportsperson of the Year, BBC 100 Women and Wisden Leading Woman Cricketer in the World, all in the year 2017. <br><br>

But behind all her success lies a story of unseen hard work. Mithali was a young 10 year old when her coach, Sampath Kumar took the responsibility to train her to be the best. She had to give up dancing, which she was very passionate about so that she could focus on her sessions. Her training was so rigorous that apart from her six hour coaching sessions, her coach made her practise hitting straight in the narrow corridors of her school and would hit her with a stick if the ball touched the walls. She even performed catching drills with stones so that she could get at the ball with soft hands and sometimes she would train even after sunset. Unfortunately just when Mithali was picked for the World Cup probables camp, Sampath died in a motorcycle accident and that absolutely crushed her but she still fought through her loss. <br><br>

In 2019, she became the first woman cricketer to have an international career lasting more than 20 years. Mithali also captained the Indian Women’s Cricket team in Test matches and ODIs until she retired in 2019 so that she can focus her energy on fulfilling her dream to bring the World Cup to her country by 2021. Mithali has managed to earn a name for herself in this sport, even though cricket, till date, is predominantly considered a male sport. She gives hope to all those girls who feel that there is no scope for women cricketers in India, she is a true inspiration and a great role model.<br><br>
