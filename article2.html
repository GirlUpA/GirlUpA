	<p class="px-5">A Crash Course on the Horrors of the Internet that Women Face!<br>
-Annanya Srivastava<br><br>

Gender-based online harassment, sexual or otherwise, stems from the root cause of misogyny, and its underlying social constructs that insist on women’s inferiority to men in every aspect of life. Gender-based hate is simply intended to restore and reinforce the societal differences between women and men. It’s this kind of bigoted mindset that members of GirlUp Athena vow to condemn at every opportunity we get.<br> <br>

As the internet becomes an increasingly important part of human existence and a critical space for marginalized populations to make their voices heard, a woman's inability to feel safe online impedes her freedom, as well as to her basic human rights. Yet the problem of online violence and harassment is often overlooked in discussions of violence against women. Contrary to the claims that cyberhate is innocuous as compared to physical violence, the long-lasting psychological troubles are evidence enough for the widespread, substantial suffering that women face as a result of online harassment. <br><br>

Studies conducted by Stanford University have suggested that up to 73 percent of women have been exposed to or have experienced some form of online violence through various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, and TikTok. The sheer volume of cyber harassment may have severe social and economic implications for womens’ status on the internet alongside chilling effects on free speech and advocacy. Harassment of young women directed in different manners- ranging from threats of sexual violence to racist slurs to cyberstalking. It was also observed that members of the LGBTQIA+ community, particularly people who identify as women (both transgendered and cis-gendered), gender non-conforming, non-binary, and gender-fluid, significantly face more abuse and forms of hate speech.<br><br>

The WWW Foundation has found that law enforcement agencies and the courts are failing to take appropriate actions for cyber harassment against women in 74% of 86 countries surveyed. One in five female Internet users lives in a country where harassment and abuse of women online are extremely unlikely to be punished (source: The Web Index). A report from India suggests that only 35% of women in that country have reported their victimization. Women often prefer not to report cyberhate for the fear of social repercussions.<br><br>

Women aged 18 to 24 are at a heightened risk of being exposed to every kind of cyberhate; they are uniquely likely to experience stalking and sexual harassment, while also not escaping the high rates of other types of harassment common to young people in general, like physical threats. Studies have shown that 18 percent of women around the globe have experienced a form of serious Internet violence at ages as young as 15. This corresponds to about 9 million women. Women are simply not safe- not online, nor in real life and this fact should make us very angry.<br><br>

It is to be noted that we understand that men too face online harassment and we are in no way disregarding that. Research has shown that while women face more explicit threats to sexual violence, men face name-calling and threats to physical violence. This is awful and we, in no shape or form, condone such behaviors. We believe that the internet should be a safe space for all kinds of people to express themselves and we stand in solidarity with all people who’ve faced any variation of cyberhate. Rigorous oversight and enforcement of rules banning cyber hate crimes on the Internet is going to be an essential foundation for it to become a safe, respectful, and empowering space for women and girls, and by extension, for boys and men.<br><br>

Digital security is the protection of someone's identity online. Gender digital security includes training women to protect themselves, as they are the most significantly vulnerable group of people online.Some tools and tips can help people be safe. For example, Instagram has recently added a "Restrict' anti-bullying tool that allows users to restrict what some people see on your profile. Instagram also has a tool that allows its users to block their choice of words which is especially helpful in blocking out any form of hate speech. <br><br>

		Professionals in the field of cyber harassment have adopted a three-step plan as a response to any cyberhate one might receive; screenshot-block-report. Following this plan, one is to screenshot any sort of harassment they are receiving, block the sender, and report the issue to the rightful authorities.

According to a recent report published by the United Nations Broadband Commission for Digital Development, their key recommendations are based on the three ‘S’s- Sensitization, Safeguards, and Sanctions’. <br><br>

•	Preventative measures through public sensitization. Changing social attitudes and norms is the first step to shifting the way online abuse is understood and the seriousness with which it is treated. There is a need for public education and education of enforcement agency staff, such as the police. <br>
 
•	Promotion of safeguards for online safety and equality on the Internet for women and girls. Traditional violence-against-women safety frameworks include women’s shelters, crisis centers, helplines, and education: The digital world also requires safety measures to keep up with a rapidly evolving Internet. This will necessarily require resources, attention, and active participation of digital gatekeepers in industry, civil society, and governments.<br>
 
•	Putting in place and enforcement of sanctions through courts and legal systems to define and enforce compliance and effective punitive consequences for perpetrators.<br>

•	Each of these pillars of sensitization, safeguards, and sanctions supports the other pillars and will need consistent, collaborative action at many levels. <br><br>

We also believe that besides these actions, one of the most important things to keep in mind is accountability. People must take accountability for their actions rather than hide under the veil of anonymity that the internet provides. Some things that you can do are- <br><br>

•	Spread awareness. Any form of hate speech can have long-lasting results on a person’s mental health.<br>
	
•	Hold your friends accountable. To be silent is to be complicit. We want to believe that there are good people out there in the world so do your part with due diligence and call out your friends. <br>

•	If someone tells you that you’ve said something wrong- don’t argue. If a woman tells you that your words were hurtful, it is in everyone’s best interest that you accept your mistakes, apologize, and strive to be better and not repeat your actions. <br>
 
•	Keep learning. Educate yourself. Above all, be kind. <br><br>
 

Playing our part in raising awareness about this issue, we at GirlUp Athena are participating in the#UltraStopsAtNothing movement, a collaborative campaign by GirlUp India and OnePlus Student Ambassador program. Stay tuned to our social media for more.</p>
