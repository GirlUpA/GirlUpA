"Shh! Don't talk about it, it's not good, no one needs to know." This is something that most young girls are told as soon as they get their first period. <br><br>
The most ironic part of this all is that we as a society jump in to tell girls how to live like a girl, what not to talk about, but never volunteer to have an open conversation about a natural bodily function that happens monthly. EVERYBODY should know about it. We at Girl Up Athena want to open this conversation. 
Let's talk about periods! <br><br>
An important thing to remember, before we dive in, is that not everyone who menstruates in a woman, and not every woman menstruates. There are trans boys, gender-fluid and well as non-binary individuals who get their periods, and this is something we should normalise. Hence, from this point on, we shall use the gender neutral pronouns (they/them) while talking about periods. <br><br>
What is a menstrual cycle? Simply put, it is the monthly hormonal cycle that a body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. <br><br>
Every month, the body prepares itself for pregnancy. This includes the thickening of the lining of the uterus and the production of 'oocytes' (a gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; and the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to the embryo in case of 'implantation'. In case the person is not pregnant, the lining is released through the vagina, which is commonly known as a period.<br><br>
Hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) usually change throughout the cycle and can cause a myriad of symptoms. These symptoms include abdominal and pelvic cramping, lower back pain, bloating and sore breasts, food cravings, mood swings and irritability, headache, fatigue, etcetera. 
Young people usually get their first period between the age of 8 to 15 years. Cycles may change in different ways as a person grows. In most of the cases, periods are heavier for teenagers but gradually get lighter in their 20s and 30s which is completely normal.<br><br>

	<p class="px-5">For a few years after getting their first period, their cycles' time duration can go longer than 38 days, which is quite common. The regularity of the cycles is high within the three years after their first period. In their 20s and 30s, cycles are generally regular and can last anywhere from 24 to 38 days. In their 40's, the body starts the transition to "menopause".<br><br> 
"Menopause" is the natural decline of reproductive hormones when a person reaches their 40s or 50s. Cycles in this age generally become irregular and menstrual periods might stop for a month or a few months and then start again. They also might be shorter or last longer than usual or be lighter or heavier than normal. <br><br>
There are times when the changes do not occur as expected or there are some drastic changes that can be of concern. Sometimes, a childâ€™s periods start before they are 8, and they develop breasts early. This can be an isolating experience. Or for some children, their periods don't start even after they have turned 15, which is equally embarrassing. Some people have highly irregular cycles, some have excessive pain and bleeding, to an extent that they miss regular activities. It is important to consult a doctor, instead of ignoring it or taking medication at your discretion.<br><br>
As a person grows older, they experience changes, some of which are quite difficult to understand at a young age. Hence an adult needs to explain the entire process frankly, so one can be prepared. Young people need to understand that periods are natural, and not something to be embarrassed about or hide. They should be aware of the changes their body will go through, and plan for them. <br><br>
Planning involves keeping track of their period, the regularity of the periods which in turn will help them to know when they ovulate, which is when they are most likely to get pregnant, and when to expect their next period. This planning can also help in tracking problems that can be discussed with a doctor. There are many applications (on both android and apple) that help you track your periods and ovulation. 
Previous generations have been raised to believe that people must be isolated while on their periods. In many households, a person on their period is told to avoid going anywhere, not tell anyone about what is happening. A lot of people still consider periods and blood disgusting.<br><br>
<br><br>  We don't seem to acknowledge that this process is a part of the magical process of bringing life on Earth, it is something to be cherished. Let us work together to educate everyone, and help them understand what exactly periods are, and why we must talk about them.</p>
