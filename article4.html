-Content Team<br><br>

Empirical evidence shows that globally, 7 percent of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner and as many as 38 percent of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner. This heart breaking, truly disturbing statistic simply highlights the harsh truth: women around the globe are simply not safe.<br> <br>

The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) suggests that 30 percent of women in India in the age group of 15-49 have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. But this doesn’t mean that if a girl is below 15 she is safe. In fact in recent news a 2 day old baby was found brutally and mercilessly stabbed to death with a screwdriver, wrapped in a shawl and dumped beside a temple. Makes you really wonder how could someone be so heartless. <br><br>

The violence towards infants doesn’t stop there, modern medical technology has allowed for the sex of a child to be determined while the child is still a fetus. This allows families to decide if they would like to abort based on sex and female foeticide has been a major concern in this country for years. One study found that 7,997 of 8,000 abortions were of female fetuses. In order to prevent female foeticide, the Preconception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act of 1994 (PCPNDT Act 1994) was modified in 2003 so as to target medical professionals, but the Act has proven ineffective due to the lack of implementation. <br><br>

The NFHS-4 report further reveals that 6 percent women in the same age group have experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. About 31 percent of married women have experienced physical, sexual or emotional violence by their spouses. India is one of fifty countries that have not yet outlawed marital rape and 20% of Indian men admit to forcing their wives or partners to have sex.<br><br>

Dowry is illegal in India, but despite that it is still a common practice to give expensive gifts to the groom and his relatives at weddings which are hosted by the family of the bride and even though incidents of dowry deaths have decreased 4.5% from 2011 to 2012, still as many as 5,000 dowry deaths are recorded each year. <br><br>

Domestic violence against women is the top gender-related crime, while there has been a marginal increase in rapes as well as overall crime in the country, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2018.<br><br>

India’s average rate of reported rape cases is about 6.3 per 100,000 of the population. Unfortunately these statistics include only reported rape cases and many girls are afraid to speak up. According to a recent report by Livemint, about 99 percent cases of sexual violence go unreported. The extent of under-reporting tends to be higher on average in states with a low female literacy. In all, 3,78,277 cases of crimes against women were reported across the country in 2018, which was an increase in cases compared to previous years. India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) has found that between 2014 and 2018 there have been 1,483 victims of acid attacks in the country. <br><br>

From 2011 to 2012, there was a 26.3% decrease in girls imported to India from another country, but during that time there was a 5.3% increase in violations of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act (SITA). Honor killings have notably increased in some Indian states which has led to the Supreme Court of India, in June 2010, issuing notices to both the Indian central government and six states to take preventative measures against honor killings. The most prominent areas where honor killings occur in India are northern regions. <br><br>

Ranging from the so-called eve teasing and outright sexual harassment on the street or workplace, to harassment for dowry, molestation in public transport vehicles, and the often-reported rape, these crimes against women reflect the vulnerability and deep-rooted problems related to the position of women in Indian society. According to the NCRB, 24,923 cases of rape were reported in 2012, amounting to one rape every 22 minutes. <br><br>

		Gender-based violence, especially violent crime like rape, is a multifaceted problem. Although the incorporation of stricter laws and punishments are important to deter people from committing such crimes, the solution to this is much more than just promulgation. 

•	It is very important to tackle various other issues that act as contributing factors and thus play an equally important role, such as the portrayal of women in Indian media, especially cinema. This bears evidence to the deep-rooted prejudicial attitudes towards women and other deeper societal issues that are contributory to these crimes.  <br>
 
•	Introducing sex education and making it compulsory would also make a big difference. <br>
 
•	More campaigns that raise Awareness about rape and violence against women should be introduced so as to empower, help and support women. .<br>

•	But while education and woman empowerment is important, in a country that has so many issues with gender discrimination, bringing about the needed change requires dedicated and combined efforts of multiple agencies such as doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers, researchers and public health professionals too.<br><br>


We at GirlUp Athena hope to empower as many women as we can and help them escape their bad living conditions, as well as erase the very mental block that makes men believe that they own women. Join us in our fight! <br>

*We acknowledge that men are abused too, and it is even more difficult for them to come forward with their problems. We must encourage EVERYBODY to share if they are going through something, seeking help is very important. </p>
