	<p class="px-5">Myths, Well They Need to be Busted!<br>
-Kuhu Kulkarni and Tanvi Panse<br><br>

For most of us, periods come every month.  Cramps and bleeding for 3 to 8 days, food cravings, mood swings; that is all that most people seem to know about periods, but there is so much more to it than that. <br> <br>

A week or so before their period, 3 out of 4 people* go through Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), and it lasts till the beginning of periods. PMS has symptoms such as mood swings, fatigue, food cravings, sore breasts, irritability, and depression. It is caused due to the cyclic changes in hormone levels, chemical changes in the brain as well as depression, but can largely be controlled through lifestyle changes and treatments.  <br><br>

There are many myths and misconceptions about periods and PMS, and when there are myths, they need to be busted! Here are some of these myths, and what is the truth behind them: -  <br><br>

<b>Myth #1: Not everyone who gets their period is a woman, and not every woman gets their period.</b><br>
There are trans boys, non- binary and well as gender fluid individuals who get their periods because of the sexual organs they were born with. It. Is important to acknowledge them as well. And every woman does not get her period. In a condition called amenorrhea, a woman either doesn’t get her period by the age of 16, or stops getting her monthly cycle for 3 or more months. More often than not, this is treatable.
<br><br>

<b>Myth #2: One loses a lot of blood during periods.</b><br>
The truth is that people usually lose around two to three tablespoons of blood during their period, and if someone experiences heavy periods, also known as menorrhagia, they lose about four tablespoons of blood. 
Some may lose more blood, but if it starts affecting your daily life, or if you're bleeding for more than seven days, or becoming anemic, please visit a doctor. Heavy bleeding is not normal or healthy, and most people do not lose too much blood during their period. 
<br><br>

<b>Myth #3: You can't get pregnant while you're on your period. </b><br>
This is true, but there's a catch, sperm can live inside your body for five days. Hence, it's likely that sperm can stay alive through the period, making it possible to get pregnant despite being on your period or having crossed your ovulation. So, a condom is always a must if you aren't ready to commit to taking care of a baby yet, of course, it always helps to be protected from STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases.) 
<br><br>

<b>Myth #4: Period pain is like any other pain you experience.</b><br>
Ah, we wish. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Period pain is different from any other pain you have experienced, ask anyone who menstruates, and they’ll tell you the same. Period pain can interfere with work and life; it even has a medical name- dysmenorrhea, a quiet mouthful, right? Well, common dysmenorrhea is the term for common period cramps that people experience, which are mostly pretty painful, and as if all of this wasn’t enough, period cramps can also affect the person’s ability to concentrate and make them feel more anxious. 
<br><br>

<b>Myth #5: It would be best if you do not exercise during your period. </b><br>
This is probably something your mom or an auntie has told you before, mine sure has, but the truth is, this is entirely false. Instead, regular exercise goes a long way in helping with period cramps and releasing emotional stress, and it does not have to stop during your period! Exercise can reduce any feelings of fatigue you might be feeling during your period. It also releases endorphins and dopamine that help relieve stress and make you feel better and happier. 
 <br><br>

<b>Myth #6: Mood swings and food cravings are the only symptoms of PMS.</b><br>
Mood swings and food cravings are indeed a symptom of PMS, but they're not the only symptoms. PMS includes many more symptoms like headache, fatigue, irritability, tender breasts, abdominal bloating, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite or excessive hunger, and lack of concentration. Some also experience anxiety and depressed mood, crying spells, and breast, abdomen, back or muscle pain, or even pelvis pain. 
 <br><br>

<b>Myth #7: Everyone experiences PMS symptoms.</b><br>
Most people experience some PMS symptoms in their life. It is estimated that 3 out of 4 menstruating people experience some form of PMS, but mostly, they are mild. Just like the pain during periods varies from person to person, the symptoms and intensity of PMS also vary.  
For those who do experience intense symptoms, going through it is not the easiest of tasks. Mostly, the symptoms are in a predictable pattern, but the emotional stress and physical pain can interfere with daily life.
Imagine everything is going right, but then suddenly you don't feel like yourself. You are enjoying yourself with your friends and family but then suddenly your mood shifts, and you feel irritated or angry, and you don't understand why? That's PMS.  <br><br>

<b>Myth #8: You can’t go swimming while on your period.</b><br>
No swimming while on your period is now in the past, with tampons and menstrual cups available, going swimming while on your period is not a problem anymore. But yes, do be careful about the tampons you use as some might have harmful chemicals.<br><br>

<b>Myth #9: Your period stops when you get in the water.</b><br>
Your period doesn't stop when you get in the water, the period blood flow may temporarily slow down as the gravitational pull isn't as strong in the water, but the flow doesn't stop altogether.<br><br>

<b>Myth #10: You have to live with PMS.</b><br>
While there is no way of getting away from PMS symptoms, but there are ways to reduce their intensity. Some lifestyle changes, like being aware of what you eat, regular exercise, and meditation, can help you deal with PMS symptoms better. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and some medication are also available to help you deal better with PMS. <br><br>

<b>Myth #11: Period blood is unclean. </b><br>
Period discharge is made of blood, tissue from the uterus, and mucus, and it's not much different from the blood that runs through your veins so no, period blood is not unclean and nor is a menstruating person.<br><br>

PMS and periods are very natural and should not be a taboo subject, there's nothing to be ashamed of when talking about them. Everybody needs to be aware of what PMS and periods are like. <br><br>

So, let us all do our part in educating ourselves and others and put an end to the stigma attached to period talk. <br><br>

<i>*As mentioned in the article, there are trans boys, gender-fluid, and well as non-binary individuals who get their periods, and this is something we should normalize. Hence, we use the <b>gender-neutral terminology and pronouns (they/them)</b><br> while talking about periods.</i>
