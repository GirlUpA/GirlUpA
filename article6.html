-Annanya Srivastava and Glynisann Santiago<br><br>

Contraception can truly be considered one of modern medicine's greatest advances and yet, it is still one of the least talked about topics, especially in India. Talking about safer sex practices or giving any indication of the intention of performing sexual activities with your partner tends to stir up feelings of shame in many communities around the globe, including India. This is exactly the sort of taboo barrier that GirlUp Athena pledges to purge. <br> <br>

<b>What Exactly is Contraception? </b><br>
		Contraception, also known as birth control, is the use of various devices, drugs, agents, sexual practices, or surgical procedures to prevent conception or pregnancy. <br>

Birth control methods can be broadly classified into:<br>
•	barrier methods, <br>
•	methods that prevent ovulation such as the birth control pill, <br>
•	and methods that allow fertilization of the egg but prevent implantation of the fertilized egg inside the uterus (womb). <br>

In simpleton words, contraceptives not only enable people to choose when they want to have a baby, but various forms of birth control options also prevent them from acquiring or spreading sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV, Chlamydia, HPV, etc.) Couples who do not use any method of contraception have an approximately an 85% chance of experiencing pregnancy over a year.<br><br> 

<b>How Do I Choose the Ideal Contraceptive for ME?</b><br>
Well, for starters, the decision about what kind of birth control option to use is extremely personal, and there is no single choice that is safest or best for all people. The risks and benefits should actively and carefully be weighed, along with the effectiveness of each technique before choosing a birth control method. 
The contraceptive pill, for example, when used correctly, is over 99 percent effective. However, because people make mistakes, as many as 9 women each year will become pregnant while using it. Your choice of birth control should depend on several factors. These include your health, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and desire to have children in the future. A thorough and open discussion with a health care professional is the best option for making a safe and informed decision. <br><br>

Making a safe and informed decision can often be considered rather challenging so we're here to break down all the facts for you! <br><br>
1.	First off, we have one of the most common methods of birth control- hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal options of birth control involve the use of hormones to prevent ovulation in a woman. <br>
a.	Although oral contraceptive pills are the most widely used hormonal method, other options are available including the vaginal ring (which is a flexible, plastic ring that releases a low dose of progestin and estrogen over 3 weeks), hormone patches applied to the skin, and injections of progestin, more commonly known as birth control shots.<br>
b.	Nausea, weight gain, skin discoloration, acne, and bleeding between periods or spotting are all side effects of hormonal contraceptives<br>.
c.	Other side effects include but are not limited to mood swings, change in menstrual flow, breast swelling or tenderness, etc. <br>
2.	Another common method of birth control is barrier contraceptives which include diaphragms, condoms, and cervical caps. <br>
a.	Spermicide is a chemical that destroys sperm to prevent them from reaching the egg. <br>
b.	Side effects of barrier methods of birth control can include but are not limited to: An increased risk for developing urinary tract infections (UTIs) if using a diaphragm and spermicide. Leaving a diaphragm or cervical cap in for longer than 24 hours increases your risk for toxic shock syndrome. Some people may have allergies to the chemicals used in spermicide creams or other spermicide products. They may develop irritation of the vagina or penis.<br>
3.	Next, we have surgical sterilization which is a form of permanent birth control that is available for both women (tubal ligation) and men (vasectomy). <br>
a.	Although women who have had tubal ligation do not have side effects after recovering from the procedure, any surgery itself carries a small risk of infection or bleeding as well as complications from the anesthetic agents. <br>
b.	Likewise, the vasectomy procedure is associated with small risks from the procedure as well as some swelling and pain in the days following the procedure. <br>
4.	Natural methods involve <b>tracking a woman's menstrual cycle</b> to try to determine when ovulation is most likely to occur and avoiding sexual intercourse (or using barrier contraceptives) during that time. <br>
5.	And finally, we have emergency contraception types (Popularly known as <b>morning-after pills</b>) which are medication or device used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse has occurred. <br>
a.	Side effects of the morning after pill include nausea, vomiting, headache, tiredness, dizziness, breast tenderness, and lower abdominal pain.<br> 
b.	Insertion of a copper intrauterine device (IUD) is also an effective method of emergency contraception, side effects of which encompass: Copper-containing IUDs may worsen menstrual bleeding and cramps. Puncture or perforation of the uterus is a rare complication of all IUDs. IUDs that contain hormones may cause similar side effects to hormonal contraceptives, like headaches, breast tenderness, or acne.  <br><br>

<b>Menstrual Cups: What Are They? </b><br>
While menstrual cups have been around for many years, they have only recently become popular. <br>
A menstrual cup is a small, bell-shaped cup that a person can insert into their vagina to collect menstrual blood during a period. Some brands are disposable, so a person can throw them away after each use or the menstrual cycle. A person can wear a reusable cup for up to 6–12 hours before it needs to be removed and washed. <br><br>


<b>Menstrual Cups: Why Should I Choose Them?</b><br> 

There are many advantages to using a menstrual cup:<br>
•	Financial savings- One Cup can last about 8-10 years! <br>
•	Comfort and lack of anxiety about leaking through- Since it creates a suction around the hole, there is no chance of a leak, and a person can wear one while working out, swimming, or showering.<br>
•	Reduced Environmental Impact- Pads and tampons are usually single-use and come with lots of packaging, but cups are designed for years of use. This can drastically reduce how many menstrual products wind up in landfills. <br>
•	There are some anecdotal reports of people having fewer or less painful menstrual cramps while using a cup. However, some find the opposite to be true.<br>
•	Some brands report that their cups are safe and comfortable to wear during sex.<br><br>

One of the biggest concerns menstrual cup users have is about contracting toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is an infection that sometimes develops after prolonged use of tampons. However, TSS is extremely rare when using menstrual cups or tampons. Using the cup as intended and emptying and washing it frequently can help reduce the risk of infections. <br><br>

A menstrual cup can be a great option for period hygiene, especially if a person no longer wants to use pads or tampons. Reading the instructions on the packaging and become familiar with the cup before trying it for the first time is always advised. It may take several attempts to figure out how to use a cup, so patience and perseverance are key. If you're interested in using a menstrual cup, the first and most important piece of advice we can give you is to talk with your gynecologist and always be safe.<br><br>
