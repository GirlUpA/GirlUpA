	<p class="px-5">Even in 2020, Women are Not Safe: Statistics that are Truly Sad.<br>
-Tanvi Panse and Annanya Srivastava<br><br>

It’s a Wednesday, you get up to bring the newspaper inside and you hear seema tai complaining on the phone about how she gets harassed by her husband on the daily. You take matters into your own hands and find out this is a case of domestic violence you look further and see domestic violence in India includes any form of violence suffered by a person from a biological relative, but typically is the violence suffered by a woman by male members of her family or relatives. According to a National Family and Health Survey in 2005, the total lifetime prevalence of domestic violence was 33.5% and 8.5% for sexual violence among women aged 15–49. A survey carried out by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked India as the most dangerous country in the world for women.<br> <br>

The perception of women in a patriarchal society is that the involvement of women in household chores is higher than men and the perception of partner involvement is higher in men than women. This creates a barrier between the equality of men and women. The perception of partner involvement increases conflict significantly. This strategically changes the way a family works. When a woman is overpowered in such a way, domestic violence paves commonality. But how common is it in India? The large population of India means that the violence affects 27.5 million women over their lifetimes. The 2012 National Crime Records Bureau report of India states a reported crime rate of 46 per 100,000, a rape rate of 2 per 100,000, a dowry homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000, and the rate of domestic cruelty by husband or his relatives as 5.9 per 100,000. These reported rates are significantly smaller than the reported intimate partner domestic violence rates in many countries.<br><br>

Domestic violence occurs for a variety of reasons one being the dowry. Dowry payments are another manifestation of the patriarchal structure in India. There are strong links between domestic violence and dowry, a cultural practice deeply rooted in many Indian communities, which is the money, goods, or property the woman/woman's family brings to a marriage to now become under the ownership of the husband. This practice continues even today in India although banned by law since 1961, and in recent years dowry amounts have risen dramatically. <br><br>

		What can we do to put an end to this and help seema tai?<br><br>
A response could be to stop penalizing women for dirty homes. This requires a cultural shift in expectations of “good” womanhood to reduce the cultural pressure of domestic perfection, bringing men into the cleaning process is essential. This means expecting men to be equal housework sharers and not helpers. It also means not penalizing men for “not doing it right” when cleaning. Cleaning the house is a skill men can learn one toilet bowl at a time. And this is the key to reducing gender inequality in housework. Some other ways include:<br>

•	Health: Reducing excess female mortality under five and supporting equal care-seeking behavior for girls and boys.<br> 
•	Nutrition: Improving the nutrition of women and girls, especially by promoting more equitable eating practices.<br> 
•	Education: Gender-responsive support to enable out-of-school girls and boys to learn and enabling more gender-responsive curricula and pedagogy (Example: implementing new strategies for identifying vulnerable out of school girls and boys, an overhaul of textbooks so that the language, images, and messages do not perpetuate gender stereotypes)<br> 
•	Child protection: Ending child and early marriage (Example: supporting panchayats to become “child-marriage free”, facilitating girls and boys clubs that teach girls sports, photography, journalism, and other non-traditional activities) Social policy: Supporting state governments to develop gender-responsive cash transfer programs and supporting women’s leadership in local governance (Example: cash transfer program in West Bengal to enable girls to stay in school, a Resource Centre for women panchayat leaders in Jharkhand)
