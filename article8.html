“I wasn’t having regular cycles…”<br>
“I’ve been overweight my entire life, and I need a change…”<br><br>

The female body undergoes a lot of ups and downs in the course of a lifetime.<br> We’ve all heard these statements from at least one of our girlfriends. <br>
Polycystic Ovary Disease and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome are two conditions where the female body undergoes various transformations. These transformations don’t just have a physical outline to them, but also cause adverse emotional distresses to the individual. <br>
So let’s break it down.<br><br>
</p>

<b>What It Really Is</b><br><br>

PCOD, or Polycystic Ovary Disease, is a kind of hormonal disorder that affects one in 10 women. It refers to a condition when a woman has a number of small cysts in the ovaries. Besides unpredictable hormonal behaviour, this condition can trigger diabetes, infertility, acne and excessive hair growth. It is a very common condition affecting 5% to 10% of women in the age group 12–45 years, due to hormonal imbalance. It can cause problems with menstruation, making it difficult for the individual to conceive.<br> <br>

Normally, the ovaries make female sex hormones and a tiny amount of male sex hormones. These help to regulate the normal development of eggs in the ovaries during each menstrual cycle. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is related to an imbalance in these sex hormones. In PCOS, they start making a higher amount of male sex hormones. This causes patients to stop ovulating.<br><br>

Normally, one or more eggs are released during each menstrual cycle from sacs in the ovaries, the process of which is called ovulation. In polycystic ovary syndrome, the eggs in these follicles do not mature and are not released from the ovaries. Instead, they form very small cysts in the ovary, and hence the name “polycystic ovaries”. PCOS seems to run in families, so the chance of having it is higher if other women in the family have PCOS or irregular periods. <br><br>

		<b>Body Issues</b><br><br>
The hormonal imbalance and increase in male sex hormones create a prominent change in the individual’s body. These can include:<br><br>

•	Acne<br>
•	Weight gain and trouble losing weight.<br>
•	An increase in facial and body hair, with thinning of scalp hair.<br>
•	Irregular periods. Often women with PCOS have fewer than nine periods a year. Some women have no periods, whereas some experience very heavy bleeding.<br>
•	Fertility problems. Many women who have PCOS have trouble getting pregnant. Infertility is a major symptom of PCOS.<br>
•	Depression and aggressive mood swings. <br>
•	Premature deliveries.<br>
•	Diabetes.<br>
•	High blood pressure.<br><br>


Although PCOD and PCOS are conditions that don’t have an accurate cure, they can both be treated to improve fertility and control blood sugar or blood pressure levels. Treatments to control acne are very common among patients suffering from PCOD or PCOS.  Intake of extra hormones externally provides control towards excessive hormonal imbalance. Such treatments help to improve the overall condition and contain aggressive symptoms; however, a specific cure is still underway. Something we’re sure everyone is desperate to see.<br><br>

<b>Scars and Humiliation (How women feel due to the physical manifestations of the disease)</b><br><br>
These conditions affect the female image a girl in these times, so desperately craves to have, very drastically. The changes in her appearance leads to embarrassment, and reduced confidence. Anxiety and hysteria gets to her, emotionally affecting the mood, not just hormonally anymore, but out of humiliation. <br><br>

We know that every body, is beautiful in its own ways. The imperfections are what make them you, unique. But the societal standards we impose do no help to anyone today. The constant pressure can push these girls towards severe depression in trying to achieve something that is totally out of their control, and this is what is absolutely shameful, immoral and disgraceful for us to know as a community.<br><br>

Upon reading countless articles while doing my research, the stories some girls had to tell, were absolute disheartening. Thousands of rupees are spent on hair removal and acne treatments; some go to the extent of surgically getting their bodies restructured; and all of this, JUST to fit in. But why create this pressure? Are we not womanly enough with a little more hair, a cheekier frame or a few more scars? Who decides these rules? There is no need for us all to look like clones of a decided standard because there really isn’t one.<br><br>

So lets make it an emotionally safer environment for those around us and scrap away this toxic female ideology of a “feminine” body, and lets live to empower each other.<br>
