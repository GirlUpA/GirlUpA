Mary Kom is now a household name in India, but this success did not come easy for her. She made her world debut at the first Women Boxing Championship in Pennsylvania, USA, at the mere age of 18, and getting there from Kangathei, a village in Manipur was not easy. Growing up, she was told that sports are not for girls. She used to play with the boys in her village, and even after a few years in boxing, she often struggled to find female boxers to practice with. <br><br>
Initially, her family was not very keen on her pursuing boxing; they were worried she wouldn't get a good marriage proposal if she bruised her face in the sport. Moreover, boxing wasn't a trendy sport either, and those who knew about it held the conception that it is a sport for men, not women. Many people laughed at her when she said she wanted to take up boxing, and she had to face all these challenges before she even debuted and had to make herself believe that she belonged to boxing. She says every medal she's won is a story of a difficult struggle, and we don't doubt that. <br><br>
    Mary had to walk miles to practice in her early days of boxing. Even as a state and national level player, she had to travel in sleeper class with no facilities. Yet, today when she looks back at those times, she says it's okay and talks about how she wouldn't have been where she is today if it weren't for the challenges she faced. <br>
    Even after establishing herself in the sport, the challenges did not cease for Mary. Once she got married in 2005, people began doubting if and how she would continue boxing because women do not often continue in sports after marriage, and especially a sport like boxing that's so physical and intensive. Then again, when she became a mother for the first time in 2007, things got more complicated. This time, even her father had his doubts about Mary returning to boxing. Her son was facing severe medical conditions, but her husband encouraged her to continue boxing. After a short hiatus, Mary returned to boxing and proved to the world that getting married and having children does not stop her. She went on to win a silver medal at the 2008 Asian Women's Boxing Championship in India and a gold medal in 2009 at the Asian Indoor Games in Vietnam after her hiatus. It definitely must not have been easy, but she never gave up. <br><br>
Mary's story is one of a kind. She did not have any facilities, significantly less support, and many challenges in her way. She overcame gender bias, poverty, and we cannot imagine the amount of dedication and strength it must have required, both physically and mentally, to become so successful in a sport as intense as boxing. <br>
Today, apart from being a role model, Mary Kom is the only female to become World Amateur Boxing Champion six times, the only female boxer to have won a medal in all of the seven World Championships, the only boxer, male and female, to win eight World Championship medals! <br><br>
