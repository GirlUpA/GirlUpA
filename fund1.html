For GirlUp Athena’s first activity, we found the perfect opportunity in a collaboration with Yug Foundation. Yug Foundation is a non-profit organization which primarily focuses on women and youth empowerment. Their goal is to help educate and facilitate women and youth towards their own sustainability. When we found out about their initiative via their Whatsapp group, we thought it would be an excellent way to kick start the GirlUp year especially considering the dire need of electronics in remote learning that has been brought about by the country-wide lockdown. The global pandemic has caused a massive shift in the way children are being educated. With education primarily being shifted to online modes, it is the children of low income families who are truly suffering. <br><br>
The objective of this activity was to collect mobile phones in working conditions to donate to underprivileged children in rural areas. Our goal is to collect as many working gadgets as we can in order to help as many kids as possible. In support of the Yug Foundation, a mobile collection and donation drive was set up by members of GirlUp Athena in the month of July, 2020. We started to spread the word by circulating digital flyers through Whatsapp messages and on various Whatsapp groups whilst also making several social media posts about the same and repeatedly disseminating them. A large number of Athena members contributed to the cause; whether that was donating the gadgets in question or simply spreading the message, no job is too small. Support is expected from all members, a ton of which was well received.<br><br>

	<p class="px-5">The drive was set up in early July and is actively in progress as of August, 2020. The working gadgets that are collected through the members of GirlUp Athena will be donated to the girls in need of them. The donor of the phone will be at the receiving end of a personalized thank-you card from the child that received it alongside a note stating that they have, in fact, received it. This was done to ensure total transparency in the process. The goal that Athena has determinately set is to help as many children as possible in trying times like these. We believe that everyone deserves an education and a global pandemic should certainly not be the reason why young minds aren’t receiving it. <br><br>
Even though we have only yet received a small amount of contribution, we are not disheartened. We have definitely faced challenges in collecting working spare phones but we are still hoping to gather more. Our members are optimistic that as we continue to spread the word, more and more people will realize this is a cause worth giving to. At the end of the day, our goal is to help those we can in whatever way possible.<br><br></p>
