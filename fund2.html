Being a woman is a beautiful journey, but it encompasses a myriad of complexities. One of these complexities is menstruation, a monthly process during which a woman’s body discharges blood and parts of the lining of the uterus monthly. It comes with countless struggles- cramps, tiredness, mood changes, acne, breast soreness, headaches, diarrhea and food cravings. Women are taught to deal with all of this silently and secretively. <br><br>
Despite the tremendous role it plays in the life of a woman, the conversation about menstrual health has always been a matter of subordinate importance in our country.  This was something that Girl Up Athena wanted to change. We feel passionate about empowering our sisters from the underprivileged strata of society, and this was our first attempt to do the same.<br><br>
Upon researching the factual database before initiating the drive, we realized that only around 20% of the girls in India use sanitary napkins or have access to the same; the number increasing to a 50% in urban areas. More than a third of girls in South Asia miss school during their period, often because they lack access to menstrual health products, or receive little or no education about menstruation before reaching puberty.<br><br>
The barriers to adopting these menstrual hygiene practices are three-fold: a lack of awareness, a lack of acceptance, and a lack of access.<br><br>
Studies show that around 71% of adolescent girls remain unaware of menstruation until their first cycle. A pad is looked at as a “good-to-have” accessory rather than a requisite. This lack of complete acceptance raises a negative connotation around the subject of menstruation, leading to anxiety or embarrassment. Women try to hide it or keep it secret.<br><br>

	<p class="px-5">A lack of access to good quality hygiene products continues to be a barrier in India. Almost 88% of women in India use alternatives like cloth rags, hay, sand or ash.<br><br>
After reflecting upon these hinderances, we at Girl Up Athena, in collaboration with Yug Foundation, took it upon ourselves to raise funds to contribute towards this crusade. We initiated a drive; whose purpose was to raise enough money so that girls between the age group of 12yrs – 16yrs living in Low Income Groups (LIG) could avail sanitary napkins. Living during a pandemic, we opted for online platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. These online platforms have proved to be an effective tool in spreading the message. The drive was aggressively implemented on all our platforms to ensure maximum reach.
Girls from these groups often lack hygiene and are forced to live with it because of their s financial conditions. This drive took a step towards their betterment, we wanted to ensure a year’s stock of sanitary napkins for these girls. <br><br>
The response we received was nothing short of great, especially considering the total amount received by the team. With a total of about 40 donations and still counting, it was astounding to see the people responding within a short period of time considering the fact that this pandemic has already created a financial burden. To see citizens still go out of their way to help someone during these times is truly heartwarming. <br><br>
The fund has crossed Rs.14,000 as of now, and the donation amount ranges from Rs.300 to as high as Rs.1,500 from a single person. <br><br>
This was one of the first initiatives taken by us, and we wait to see what more unfolds in the future. Our enthusiasm towards creating a world that is a safe haven for young women; not just literally, but mentally and socially will be ceaseless, until we see change. It’s a long process, but it’ll be worth it.<br><br></p>
