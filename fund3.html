You wake up on a Monday morning, brush your teeth, you know the usual. Only to open your Instagram to stories of black and white pictures overrun by women. What do these women want to convey through these stories? But does it run deeper than what is on the surface? We at Girl Up Athena would like to answer that for you!<br><br>
It works like this: a monochrome image of the participant is posted onto her social media with the hashtag #womensupportingwomen. The participant gets to nominate however many women as she pleases. This not only serves as social empowerment for women but also fulfils a cause. What cause you may be wondering? Many people originally started posting black and white images to bring about cancer awareness and it ran globally in the blink of an eye.<br><br>
Recently, this movement gained new momentum in Turkey, when a 27 year old student Pinar Gültekin was killed by her former boyfriend. Turkey currently has the highest rate of femicides among the OECD countries. 474 women were killed there in 2019—a 200% increase since 237 women were lost in 2013. It is also estimated that, so far in 2020 alone, 146 Turkish women have been murdered.<br><br>
The black and white challenge was thus started to spread awareness. To everyone’s surprise, more than 3 million photos have been shared under this hashtag. Here is what we, at Girl Up Athena, have done to spread the message!<br><br>

	<p class="px-5">Girl up decided to design a template to share on Instagram stories as a part of the challenge. We had two main goals. One, bringing in not just girls, but all genders to participate. Two, to educate everybody about what is going on in Turkey. If it wasn’t for this challenge many of us would still be clueless as to what is exactly going on in Turkey.<br><br> A link was added into Girl Up Athena’s bio on Instagram which would redirect you to a webpage with all details of this incident and it’s repercussions. Not to mention, the message was spread across social media and around 400 people viewed the story that was posted about the challenge!<br><br>
Here is some more information you should know! There were talks about turkey getting out of the Istanbul convention in July 2020. The Istanbul convention is a human rights treaty of the council of Europe against the violence against women and domestic violence. The challenge soon travelled to many English speaking countries which showed astounding participation for the same.<br><br>
This conversation lead Indian women to reiterate that gender based violence is just as common in India in all its forms. Actress Urmila Matondkar was quoted saying, “So glad that through this trend we all are acknowledging the need to support n strengthen each other. I’ve always maintained that the first step to #womenempowerment is women supporting n standing up for each other… So Bravo”<br><br>
We need to take back the power and effectively use the black and white challenge to raise our voices and create awareness about gender based violence. <br><br>
Even though it may seem like a small task, so many women from across the world united so that they could make a statement is actually a really big achievement! We at Girl Up Athena are so proud to be an active voice in such a ground breaking movement.<br><br></p>
