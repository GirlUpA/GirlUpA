Due to the sorry nature of sex education classes in schools, young children have taken to finding whatever information they can on the internet, through gossip, and from Wattpad fanfiction. However, we at Girl Up Athena believe that it is imperative that we are properly educated by experts when it comes to matters of our bodies, menstruation, hygiene and safe sex practices.

	<p class="px-5">The 26th of September is celebrated as World Contraceptive Day, and we felt that there was no better way to celebrate this day than with our Girl Up family, learning something new. We hosted a webinar with Dr Pratibha Bhave, a gynaecologist from Pune.<br><br>
She delivered an excellent presentation explaining to us the basics of the female anatomy and covered the various other topics we asked her to, based on a questionnaire we distributed earlier.<br><br>
The engaging presentation was unfortunately cut sort because of internet issues on her part, but the proactive team at Athena quickly took over and conducted a discussion based on the question that had been submitted. While it wasnâ€™t an opinion from an expert, it was a community building session where spoke abut our tips on dealing with period cramps, which menstrual cup brands could be trusted, what is the best way to deal with pubic hair, and about our opinions on sex education in schools.<br><br>
The few boys in the group chimed in as well and gave us a valuable insight into things they go through, while learning form the girls why they should know more about periods and why it is rude to ask if girls are PMSing.<br><br>
Slowly, as the participants became more and more comfortable, they started voicing all of their problems and opinions, and it became a very dynamic discussion that left everybody with something new to try out, fresh facts to ponder over, and a community to confide in.<br><br>
Despite the webinar not going as originally planned, we are very proud that session, and plan to have many such group discussions in the future!
